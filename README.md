holbertonschool-printf

Printf function developed for a Holberton School project

Function that produces output according to a format, using the format specifiers %s, %c, %d, and %i.

GUIDELINES

Use the prototype: *int _printf(const char _format, ...);

Print all of format* to std output and handle the conversion specifiers: "c", "s", "%", "d", and "i"

Returns the number of characters printed written in vi, vim, or emacs

Must be compiled with the following command gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic -std=gnu89 -Wno-format *.c

No more than five functions per file

We are learning to use multiple functions and the use of a variadic functions, and passing the logic using format sepcifiers.
